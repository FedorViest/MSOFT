All GUI windows were created with [Qt Designer](https://build-system.fman.io/qt-designer-download). They were then 
modified for application needs. Each GUI class contains setupUi() method which is generated by Qt Designer. This method 
inicializes all GUI elements. Each GUI class also contains retranslateUi() method which is also generated by Qt 
Designer. In this method all GUI elements are styled if needed and translated from code into window.

File utils.py acts as a bridge between GUI and backend. It contains all data and information needed for GUI to work.

In this application user can create route, list created routes and share saved routes.

#### UC01 - Vytvor trasu and UC03 - Zdielaj trasu were implemented in this application.
